## 📖 Overview

**XSS Scanner** is a fully modular, Python-based tool for detecting **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities in web applications. It combines an intelligent web crawler, multiple detection engines, advanced payload encoding, false-positive filtering, and HTML report generation into a clean, extensible architecture.

Designed for **security researchers**, **penetration testers**, and **developers** who want to audit their applications for XSS vulnerabilities before attackers do.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🕷️ **Web Crawler** — Automatically spiders target websites to discover all endpoints and injectable parameters
- 🔍 **Reflected XSS Detection** — Tests URL parameters for content reflected in server responses
- 🧠 **DOM-Based XSS Detection** — Analyzes client-side JavaScript sinks for DOM manipulation vulnerabilities
- 📝 **Form Detection** — Discovers and tests all HTML form inputs for injection points
- 💉 **Advanced Payload Engine** — Ships with a curated payload library plus encoding techniques (HTML, URL, Unicode) to bypass filters
- 🎯 **Custom Payloads** — Supports user-supplied payload lists via `payloads/custom_payloads.txt`
- 🚫 **False Positive Filtering** — Intelligent analysis to reduce noise and improve result accuracy
- 📊 **HTML Report Generation** — Produces detailed, styled HTML vulnerability reports
- ⚙️ **Configurable** — Centralized `config.py` for easy tuning of scan behaviour

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.8** or higher
- pip

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rohit-1006/XSS_Scanner.git

# 2. Navigate into the directory
cd XSS_Scanner

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python main.py -u <target_url> [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-u`, `--url` | **Required.** Target URL to scan |
| `-c`, `--crawl` | Enable web crawler to discover all endpoints |
| `--forms` | Scan HTML forms for injection points |
| `--dom` | Enable DOM-based XSS analysis |
| `--payloads` | Path to a custom payloads file |
| `--encode` | Apply encoding to payloads to bypass filters |
| `--report` | Generate an HTML report of findings |
| `--threads` | Number of concurrent threads (default: 5) |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Enable verbose output |

> **Note:** Update this table to reflect your exact CLI flags from `main.py`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize scan behaviour:

```python
# config.py (example settings)
THREADS          = 10            # Concurrent scanning threads
TIMEOUT          = 10            # Request timeout in seconds
MAX_DEPTH        = 3             # Crawler depth limit
USER_AGENT       = "XSSScanner/1.0"
FOLLOW_REDIRECTS = True
REPORT_OUTPUT    = "report.html"
```

## 🔬 How It Works

```
Target URL
    │
    ▼
[spider.py] ─────────── Crawls the target, discovers URLs, params & forms
    │
    ▼
[form_detector.py] ───── Extracts input fields from discovered HTML forms
    │
    ▼
[injector.py] ─────────── Injects payloads from payloads.py / advanced_payloads.py
[encoders.py] ─────────── Optionally encodes payloads to evade filters
    │
    ▼
[reflection.py] ──────── Checks if payloads appear in HTTP responses
[dom_analyzer.py] ────── Checks for DOM sinks executing injected scripts
    │
    ▼
[false_positive.py] ───── Filters noise and confirms true positives
    │
    ▼
[html_report.py] ─────── Generates a detailed HTML vulnerability report
```
